# 📊 CS50 Final Project – Calculator

Welcome to my final project for **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python**.  
This project is a **command-line based calculator** that can perform four basic arithmetic operations. It's simple, efficient, and built entirely using Python.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To demonstrate understanding of Python fundamentals—including variables, functions, conditionals, and error handling—by creating a fully functional calculator that accepts user input and processes arithmetic operations.

---

## ⚙️ Features

The calculator supports the following **four arithmetic operations**:

### ➕ Addition (`+`)
- Combines two numbers to return their sum.
- **Example**:  
  `Input: 5 + 3`  
  `Output: 8`

### ➖ Subtraction (`-`)
- Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Example**:  
  `Input: 10 - 4`  
  `Output: 6`

### ✖️ Multiplication (`*`)
- Multiplies two numbers.
- **Example**:  
  `Input: 7 * 6`  
  `Output: 42`

### ➗ Division (`/`)
- Divides the first number by the second. Includes error handling for division by zero.
- **Example**:  
  `Input: 20 / 5`  
  `Output: 4.0`  
  `Input: 5 / 0`  
  `Output: Error! Cannot divide by zero.`

## 📌 Examples

Here are some sample inputs and outputs:

**Addition**
Input: 4 + 5
Output: 9


**Subtraction**
Input: 10 - 3
Output: 7


**Multiplication**
Input: 6 * 6
Output: 36


**Division**
Input: 12 / 4
Output: 3.0

Input: 10 / 0
Output: Error! Cannot divide by zero.

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes unit tests written using Python’s built-in `unittest` module.  
To test whether all calculator operations are working correctly, run the following command:

```bash
python test_project.py
